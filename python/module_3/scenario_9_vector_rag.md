# Scenario 9: Vector RAG: Retrieve relevant data from a vector database

This scenario demonstrates a more advanced form of RAG using vector embeddings.

## What you'll learn:
- How to use vector embeddings for semantic search
- How to store and retrieve information from a vector database
- Advanced RAG techniques for more accurate information retrieval

## Key concepts:
- **Vector embeddings**: Converting text to numerical representations
- **Semantic search**: Finding information based on meaning rather than keywords
- **Vector databases**: Specialized databases for storing and querying embeddings
