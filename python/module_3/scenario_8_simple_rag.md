# Scenario 8: Basic RAG: Load additional data into the context

This scenario shows how to implement basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## What you'll learn:
- Fundamentals of RAG implementation
- How to load and incorporate external data into model prompts
- Benefits of providing relevant context to the model

## Key concepts:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Enhancing model responses with external data
- **Context window management**: How to handle large amounts of context
- **Information retrieval**: Techniques for finding relevant information to include in prompts
