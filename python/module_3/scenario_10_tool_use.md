# Scenario 10: Tool use (a.k.a. function calling)

This scenario shows how to use the model's ability to call external tools or functions.

## What you'll learn:
- How to define tools that the model can use
- How the model decides which tool to use based on the user's request
- How to handle tool responses and integrate them into the conversation

## Key concepts:
- **Function calling**: Enabling models to invoke external functions
- **Tool selection**: How models choose appropriate tools for a task
- **Response integration**: Incorporating tool results back into the conversation
